# Project Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines potential areas for improvement for the Adventurers Guild website.

## Code & Structure

*   **Component Organization:** The `components/ui` directory contains many individual component files. Consider grouping related components into subdirectories to improve discoverability and maintainability. For example, form-related components (`input.tsx`, `label.tsx`, `button.tsx`) could be moved to a `components/ui/form` directory.
*   **State Management:** The project currently lacks a dedicated state management library (like Redux or Zustand). If you plan to add features with complex, shared state (e.g., user authentication, quest progress), integrating a state management solution would be beneficial.
*   **API Routes:** There are no API routes defined in `app/api`. For features that require server-side logic, like fetching data from a database or interacting with external services, you will need to create API routes.
*   **Environment Variables:** The project does not currently use an environment variable file (e.g., `.env`). For storing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials, it is crucial to use environment variables and add the `.env` file to `.gitignore` to keep secrets out of version control.

## Performance

*   **Image Optimization:** The project uses `.png` and `.jpg` images. To improve loading times, consider converting them to a more modern format like WebP, which offers better compression. Next.js's built-in `Image` component can automate this optimization.
*   **Code Splitting:**  While Next.js handles page-based code splitting automatically, you can further optimize performance by dynamically importing components that are not required for the initial render (e.g., components that are off-screen).
*   **Bundle Size Analysis:** Use a tool like `@next/bundle-analyzer` to inspect the size of your JavaScript bundles. This can help identify large dependencies that could be replaced with smaller alternatives.

## Accessibility (a11y)

*   **Semantic HTML:** Review the HTML structure to ensure it is semantic. Using correct heading levels (h1, h2, etc.) and HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, etc.) improves accessibility for screen reader users.
*   **Image Alt Text:** Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` text. The current placeholder images should be replaced with meaningful images that have appropriate alt text.

## Testing

*   **Unit & Integration Tests:** The project currently has no tests. Introduce a testing framework like Jest or Vitest to write unit and integration tests for your components and utility functions. This will help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** For testing critical user flows (e.g., the "Join Us" form submission), consider setting up an E2E testing framework like Cypress or Playwright.

## Security

*   **Input Validation:** The "Join Us" page contains a form. It is critical to validate all user input on both the client-side and server-side to prevent security vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The project already uses `zod`, which is excellent for this purpose; ensure it's being used comprehensively.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** If you plan to add user accounts, a secure and robust authentication and authorization system will need to be implemented.
