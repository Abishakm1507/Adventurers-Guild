**Ever read a manga and wished there was an Adventurer's Guild for your own craft? This is itâ€”for coders.**

This open-source project is a digital guild hall where developers can find their next adventure. Instead of slaying slimes, you'll be squashing bugs. Instead of exploring dungeons, you'll be building epic features.

For Contributers vie the CONTRIUTING.md for the instructions

## How It Works

Just like any guild, we have a structured way for adventurers to prove their worth:

*   **The Quest Board:** This is where you'll find all available tasks. Quests are ranked by difficulty, from E-Rank (simple bug fixes, documentation updates) to S-Rank (major feature implementation, architectural changes).
*   **Form a Party:** Don't want to go it alone? Team up with other developers on a feature branch to tackle more difficult quests together.
*   **Raise Your Rank:** Complete quests to earn experience, build your reputation, and rise through the guild ranks. Your profile on the Guild Roster will display your achievements for all to see.
*   **Earn Your Rewards:** Your reward is tangible: a powerful portfolio, real-world experience, and a legendary contribution graph on GitHub.

## Tech Stack

The guild hall is built with modern, powerful magic (technologies):

*   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
